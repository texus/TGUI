### Collected data
In order to estimate the amount of visitors and downloads, and to check the incoming and outgoing links, [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) is used to track your activity on this site. The collected data is private and is not shared with third parties. A summary of the data (e.g. the total amount of visitors or downloads over a certain period) may however be made publicly available.


### Opt-out
Matomo respects the [Do Not Track header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track). When your browser is set to send this DNT header then your information will not be stored.


### Policy changes
This privacy policy can change at any time without a warning.  
However, because the site is open-source and hosted on Github Pages, you can follow all changes on [github](https://github.com/texus/TGUI/commits/gh-pages/privacy-policy/index.md).
